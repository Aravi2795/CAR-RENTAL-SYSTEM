# CAR-RENTAL-SYSTEM

Java-Console-Car-Rental-System

This is a simple Java console application for a car rental system. It allows users to log in, view available cars, rent cars, return rented cars, display all cars, and log out. The application uses a HashMap to store user credentials and a separate Business Logic (BL) class to handle the renting and returning of cars.

This code is a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn Java programming or develop a more complex car rental management system. Feel free to use and modify the code according to your needs.
